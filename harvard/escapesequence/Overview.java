		// Think of a class as a container for the program
		// Code inside the method is enclosed in curly braces 
		// Annotations easily identify methods   
		// Statement typically ends with semicolon
		// Statements are executed sequentially
		// Identifiers are naming combination of java programs
		// Identifiers cannot be the same as a keyword
		// Java is case-sensitive meaning System.out.print is not the same as system.out.Print which could result in confusions,error. 
		// Literals specified explicitly in the program
		/* String literal enclosed in double quotes Example: 
		"Computed Result" and char literals in single quote 'A' */
		// Constructor name must be the same as Class name
		// Create an instances of class by creating object for the class.
		/* { braces are very important part of program flow such as
		   if,for,while,do-while and switch } */
		// However, square bracket[] is used to index access elements in arrays,strings
