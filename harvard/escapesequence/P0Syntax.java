		// Think of a class as a container for the program
		// Code inside the method is enclosed in curly braces 
		// Annotations easily identify methods   
		// Statement typically ends with semicolon
		// Statements are executed sequentially
		// Identifiers are naming combination of java programs
		// Identifiers cannot be the same as a keyword
		// Java is case-sensitive meaning System.out.print is not the same as system.out.Print
		// Literal specified explicitly in the program
		// String literal enclosed in "Computed Result" and char literals in 'A'
		// Constructor name must be the same as Class name
		// Create an instances of class by creating object for the class.
		// { braces are very important part of program flow such as
		// if,for,while,do-while and switch }
		// However, squared[] are used to index access elements in arrays,strings and
		// angular<> frequently used in data structures
